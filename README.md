# Effekt 2D Game Engine for Bachelor Thesis

## Usage

1. Install Effekt as described in https://effekt-lang.org/docs

2.
- Compile the included `main.effekt` file with the provided `build.sh` script for Linux (Mac and Windows should work with the same command inside the `build.sh`, but replacing `effekt.sh` with `effekt`)
- Or change the code inside the `main.effekt` (it is configured to run the Snake game by default) and compile it
- Or copy the `game_engine_lib` folder in your own project and import the required modules with `import game_engine_lib/<module>`, then compile your `main.effekt`

3. Open the produced `out/main.html` file in your HTML5-capable browser
